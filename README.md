This is my first upload on Github, hopefully this will be the first of many
In this upload I have performed a simple linear regression manually
When i say manually I mean that I have not used any libraries to perform any calculations
Please note that the Best Fit line in this code is not achieved by iterating the different slopes and intercepts. 
It is simply to show how Linear Regression is done mathematically using python. 
For Beginners and educational purpose only!
